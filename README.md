### Summary

Welcome to Picky Chicky! In this game, you will help Chick - who is quite picky - to obtain the worm and avoid the spider. Catching each worm will get you a point, but beware: catchin a single spider will end the game, as you have disappointed Chicky.

### Linting with Pylint

When linting this code with pylint, use the `--unsafe-load-any-extension=y` argument. This is because pylint does not load the C extensions from `pygame` by default, and will throw errors around methods imported from pygame.
