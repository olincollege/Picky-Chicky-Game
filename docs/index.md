# Picky Chicky

Welcome to ***Picky Chicky***! In this game, you will help Chicky - who is quite picky - only obtain the worm and avoid the spider. Catching each worm will get you a point, but beware: catching a single spider will end the game, as you have disapppointed Chicky.

## Unique Features

The game consists of 3 characters: Chicky, Wormy, and Spidey. 

### Gameboard

Custom pixel art

### Navigation

By using the left and right arrows, you can help Chicky move around to dodge the spiders and obtain the worms.

### Falling items

During gameplay, you will see Wormy and Spidey falling from the top of the screen. And what's the fun part, you ask? They fall faster and faster by the *second*, so put your reflexes to the test and avoid Spidey as best as you can!
